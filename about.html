      <p>I was inspired to create a long scrolling website about animals affected by global warming when I saw the <a href="http://lostworldsfairs.com/atlantis/" class="resources">Atlantis World's Fair - Lost World's Fairs</a> long scrolling website. We animated the boat and the waves from this website as an example and it made me think of polar bears on icebergs. From there, I thought about making the rest of the page being about animals that lived in the sea. I chose animals that lived in water that were affected by global warming from the article, <a href="http://www.brighthub.com/environment/science-environmental/articles/80105.aspx" class="resources">"Effects of Global Warming on Animal Behavior"</a>, to be on my long scrolling website. My process involved creating rough sketches of my ideas, going into illustrator to draw out all the pieces, and making use of CSS and JS to animate the images on my long scrolling website.</p>
